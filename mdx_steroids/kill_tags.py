# mdx_steroids.kill_tags

The `mdx_steroids.kill_tags` removes requested HTML elements from final HTML output.

### Installation

```bash
pip install --user --upgrade git+https://github.com/twardoch/markdown-steroids.git
```

### Docs

* https://github.com/twardoch/markdown-steroids

### Options

* The `kill` option allows to specify a list of CSS selectors or (when using the "!" prefix), XPath selectors.
Elements matching to these selectors will be completely removed from the final HTML.

* The `kill_known` option allows to remove (if true) or keep (if false) certain hardcoded selectors.

* The `kill_empty` option allows to specify a list of simple element tags which will be removed if they’re empty.

* The `normalize` option will pass the final HTML through BeautifulSoup if true.

```yaml
  mdx_steroids.kill_tags:
    normalize: false  # Do not use BeautifulSoup for post-processing
    kill:             # List of CSS selectors or (with "!" prefix) XPath selectors to delete
      - "!//pre[@class and contains(concat(' ', normalize-space(@class), ' '), ' highlight ') and code[@class and
      contains(concat(' ', normalize-space(@class), ' '), ' language-del ')]]"
      - del
    kill_known: false # Do not remove some hardcoded "known" selectors
    kill_empty:       # List of HTML tags (simple) to be removed if they’re empty
      - p
      - div
```

### Example

This assumes the `pymdownx.tilde` extension being used, and the above configuration.

#### Input Markdown 1

This is an example where a portion of inline text has been surrounded with `~~` on each side, which will be visible in the Github wiki preview~~ but will be deleted from the final HTML~~. And this is another example where a portion of inline text has been surrounded with the HTML tag `del` on each side<del> and it also will be deleted from the final HTML</del>.

This is a visible paragraph before the special del block.

```del
